<p>On May 23, 1923 the <strong>"Sikorsky Aero Engineering Corporation"</strong> was founded near Roosevelt Field by <i>Igor Sikorsky</i>, an immigrant to the United States who was born in Kiev. Igor Sikorsky originally concentrated on the development of multi-engined landplanes and then amphibious aircraft. In the late 1930s, sales declined and United Aircraft merged his division with Vought Aircraft. He took this opportunity to begin work on developing a practical helicopter. After first flying the VS-300 he developed the Sikorsky R-4, the first stable, single-rotor, fully controllable helicopter to enter large full-scale production in 1942, upon which the majority of subsequent helicopters were based (though Sikorsky did not invent the helicopter itself).</p>
