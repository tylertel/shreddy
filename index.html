                <p>Mmm, a little birdie told me this morning that Steamboat is serving tasty uncut powder for breakfast with white coffee extra fluffy!

We received steady snow yesterday beginning around noon, with heavy snowfall off and on throughout the evening and into the white witching hours of the night. The first layer on the cake mid-day yesterday was heavy, providing a nice thick creamy base layer, mid-late afternoon we experienced fully popped popcorn kernels puking from the sky. The temperatures dropped nicely overnight creating the soft fluffy goodness we all lay in our beds the night before tossing and turning because we’re so excited for the lifts to start turning we can’t sleep. Wait, you guys don’t do that? Yeah, um, me neither, can we still be friends? -Byron Carney March 29,2018</p>

                <p>It’s hard to describe just how good the snow is. It’s good. It’s fantastic. It’s rad. It’s, well hard to really put one word on just how good it is.

From Twilight trees, to Closets and Shadows, to Morning Side and then over to Pony and Heavenly Daze- the snow is incredible. It snowed all yesterday on the mountain. I have to admit that I got a few turns in yesterday in the heart of the storm and it was good, really good. But, this morning is extra good because the sun is out. That’s right, we got 10″+ of freshies yesterday and the sun is out today. It’s absolutely beautiful. - Garett Mariano March 24, 2018</p>
